### Tarot
**C++ program run through a terminal** that uses a Card class and csv import to create a tarot deck. The tarot deck is then shuffled, either with random seed (dailyShuffle) or based on a user's string input (response). Users can then ask for a set number of cards to draw, and decide if they want to draw from the top of the deck or pick specific card numbers to draw.
